# Angular Course
================================================

# Description:

 * This project contains all the material that will be used during the course.
 * Theory and exercises grouped by subject.
 * TEMA11 is a Web project grouped by features.
 * Run `npm install` in order to install the app.
 * Run `node server.js` in order to start the server.
 * Run `npm test` in order to run the unit tests.
 * Run `npm run protractor` in order to run the e2e tests.

# Goals

* We will see el the concept of directive, how to create controllers and communicate them correctly. 
* We will review built-in services as well as create our own ones and our custom directives which is the killer feature of this framework. 
* We will learn how to modify the DOM as well as SVG images.  
* We will see promises and routing with both ngRoute and the UIRouter.  
* And we will build a cool web site with nested views, on-scroll animations and built only with directives. 
* All this without forgetting the importance of unit and E2E testing our code.

# Agenda

## Angular fundamentals
* Templates, views, directives, expressions
* Scope, model, modules, data binding
* Creating simple Angular apps

## Controllers and services
* Understanding Controllers and the scope
* Understanding services

## Custom directives
* Fundamentals (restrict, template, etc)

* Isolated Scope: “@”, “=” and “&”
* Modifying the DOM with JQLite

## Custom services
* Creating custom services
* Events: $on and $broadcast
* Calling external APIs: custom service + $http

## Structuring apps and routing
* Large web apps (Looking at Google recommendations)
* ngRoute

## Unit testing with Jasmine and Karma
* Unit test controllers
* Unit test directives
* Unit test services

## E2E tests with Protractor

## Promises
* $q
* The deferred API
* The promise API

## Svg manipulations

## Angular UI Router
* Router vs states
* $urlRouterProvider
* $stateProvider (templates, controllers, events, etc)

## Web project
* Routed with the state provider
* Designed with directives and only directives
